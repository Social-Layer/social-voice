# social-voice

This is the part of the ecosystem that brings participants to the online platform.

it has these broad features as requirement:

* Identity is verified as part of a mesh network (where everyone verifies people they come into contact with). If any malicious node is found, that discovery leads to a treee pruning. Due to the highly interconnected nature of this kind of application, a graph database is recommended.
* There is an encryption layer between the users mesh and the votes database, so that voters can verify the vote, but the identity of a voter is protected.
* There must be a set of people responsible for the creation of issues that voters can participate in, if they care.
* Users should also be able to proxy their vote, obviously there must be a limit to the number of votes controlled by an ordinary person.

* Timer/Filter to highlight at most 3 issues per month per region. Issues must not be raised too frequently either, because this would dilute the attention of the voters as well as the government.
